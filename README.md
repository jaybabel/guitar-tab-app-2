The lesson links section is a stretch goal to add a table with links to online lessons for the selected tablature.

The Chord Shapes/Finder is a stretch goal to open a page with the chord shapes required for the tab.  Initially, I will just put a link to a chord finder website.

The LessonLinks table is for a stretch goal.

The application will not require a user login except for the admin.  The user table will only be used for admin logon initially.  Possibly a stretch goal could be to allow optional login for non-admin accounts to enable some personalization and a dynamic rating system.
